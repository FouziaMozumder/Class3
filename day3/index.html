                        Flutter is Google’s UI Toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications mobile, web, desktop from a single codebase. This eliminates the need for separate platform oriented developers to build a single application which can be run on different platforms. Though Flutter is young, it quickly caught the attention of the mobile apps developers and became one of the most popular cross platforms. Flutter uses Dart programming language for both the UI and the logical part of a project, so it doesn’t require another markup language (like XML) or visual designer to create a user interface. Flutter and Dart are both easy to learn, easy to deploy and require less time and effort to build production ready applications from scratch. That's why most of the companies are hiring flutter (or other cross platform) developers to get the benefit of less production cost and time. 
                        
                        This course offers a very convenient way to learn Flutter from the very basic to advanced level. After completing this course, anyone will have the strong understanding of the building blocks of Flutter and the ability to build professional applications both for Android and iOS platforms.</p>
